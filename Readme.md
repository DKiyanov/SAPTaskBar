SAPTaskBar is an analogue of the standard windows taskbar, only heavily customized to the needs of SAP GUI users, makes working with SAP more enjoyable and productive.
Just like the standard window taskbar, SAPTaskBar can be placed on either side of the screen, and the buttons on the taskbar correspond to the open SAP GUI windows but:
* The task buttons are always placed on the panel, if there are too many and they do not fit on the screen, you can scroll with the mouse wheel.
* The task buttons are automatically grouped by system name and client. (The buttons are not hidden in groups, they are just placed side by side).
* The task buttons can be dragged with the mouse.
* The task button displays: a thumbnail with the current SAP GUI window contents, window title text, SAP system name
* Built-in password manager for SAP systems, you will not need to remember and enter passwords when logging into SAP systems if you want the program will do it for you.
* There are various possibilities to mark and display task buttons, for example, you can assign an icon to a window title
* There are various options for hiding buttons that are not needed at the moment and navigating through the task buttons.
* SAP GUI functionality slightly improved: when you put the cursor in the transaction input window, the input language automatically switches to English, a hotkey (ctrl + "/") was added to go to the transaction input window.
This is only a brief and very general description.
